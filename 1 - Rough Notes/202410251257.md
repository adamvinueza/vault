In [[Design Your Organization For The Conflicts You Want To Hear About]], Kellog has two pieces of advice:

1. Design for conflict: don't hide the conflicts you want to hear about beneath a layer of management.
2. Ensure value-add: make sure that putting someone in charge of an organizational unit adds value to that unit.

The second idea seems obvious to me, but the first is genuinely useful.

A thing I find off-putting in the article is Kellog's use of the phrase "in the family" for managers handling conflicts within their scope of authority. Companies aren't families! (Also, it sounds vaguely mafia-like.)
