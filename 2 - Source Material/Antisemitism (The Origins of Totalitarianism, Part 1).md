#### Chapter 1: Antisemitism as an Outrage to Common Sense

This chapter develops the main argument. Jews played a significant role in the
development of antisemitism (as opposed to what she calls "Jew-hatred"):

    Modern antisemitism must be seen in the more general framework of the
    development of the nation-state, and at the same time its source must be
    found in certain aspects of Jewish history and specifically Jewish functions
    during the last centuries. (9)

Arendt is careful to note that this is not to *blame* Jews for their own
persecution.) Victims of crimes often do things that make those crimes possible
or even likely, but the crimes are no less crimes for all that.)

The remaining chapters flesh out this thesis in more detail.
